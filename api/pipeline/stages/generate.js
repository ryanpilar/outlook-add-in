/**
 * Pipeline Stage: Generate
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * With OpenAI's Responses API doing both retrieval and drafting, generation is
 * the stage that turns our retrieval plan into three polished reply variants.
 * When fleshed out, this stage will:
 *
 * 1. Compose a shared system prompt and three differentiated user instructions
 *    (e.g., tone or framing variations) that enable File Search and constrain
 *    the model to retrieved context only.
 * 2. Call `POST /v1/responses`, attach the selected vector store IDs so OpenAI
 *    fetches supporting passages behind the scenes, and capture tool-call usage
 *    + timing for observability. (Responses API:
 *    https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses • Tools:
 *    https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools • Rate limits:
 *    https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits)
 * 3. Parse the structured output into a normalized candidate list that includes
 *    citations (file IDs, offsets/annotations), model configuration, and any
 *    observations needed for verification or UI display.
