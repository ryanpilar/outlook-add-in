Format this reply using Markdown—employ headings sparingly, bold or italic text for emphasis, bullet/numbered lists for steps, and convert URLs into Markdown links like [PEKA Resident Portal](https://peka.ab.ca). Please refrain from including final signatures, in general, or including PEKA contact information as a signature.',

Each citation must contain the exact URL visited, a short title, and the excerpt or policy detail that supports your summary. If no reliable source exists, include a single placeholder citation that clearly states no trustworthy reference was found and recommend human follow-up.',
