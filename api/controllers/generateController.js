/**
 * Generate Controller
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * With OpenAI's Responses API doing both retrieval and drafting, generation is
 * the stage that turns our retrieval plan into three polished reply variants.
 * When fleshed out, this controller will:
 *
 * 1. Compose a shared system prompt and three differentiated user instructions
 *    (e.g., tone or framing variations) that reference the `file_search` tool
 *    and constrain the model to retrieved context only.
 * 2. Call `POST /v1/responses` with `tools: [{ type: 'file_search' }]`, passing
 *    the selected vector store IDs so OpenAI fetches supporting passages behind
 *    the scenes while tracking token usage and tool call metadata.
 * 3. Parse the structured response (JSON mode) into a normalized candidate list
 *    that includes citations (file IDs, chunk offsets), model configuration, and
 *    any observations needed for verification or UI display.
 *
 * The scaffold below outlines those responsibilities while returning
 * placeholders. Future iterations will add the actual OpenAI client integration,
 * retry/backoff policies, and instrumentation.
