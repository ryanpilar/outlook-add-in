/**
 * Verify Controller
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Verification is the last safety gate before anything is shown to the user.
 * Here we confirm that the Responses API output is structurally valid, grounded
 * in retrieved documents, and safe to render. Ultimately the stage will:
 *
 * 1. Validate the JSON schema returned by the generation stage (e.g., fields for
 *    `replyHtml`, `citations`, tone labels) and sanitize any rich-text content to
 *    prevent script injection.
 * 2. Resolve OpenAI file IDs back to the human-readable metadata recorded during
 *    ingestion so the UI can render trustworthy links and attribution.
 * 3. Enforce fallbacksâ€”if no supporting files were cited or verification prompts
 *    flag contradictions, produce a safe apology/deferral response or trigger a
 *    regeneration request.
