/**
 * Retrieve Controller
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Because OpenAI's Responses API can invoke `file_search` on our behalf, the
 * runtime "retrieve" stage is chiefly about assembling the inputs that make
 * that tool call effective. When complete, this controller will:
 *
 * 1. Select which vector stores (and therefore which uploaded files) should be
 *    exposed to the Responses API by consulting the mappings created during
 *    ingestion.
 * 2. Derive search hints from the normalized email—subject keywords, sender
 *    domain, lightweight summaries—so they can be injected into the user prompt
 *    or metadata to steer the file search ranking.
 * 3. Capture an execution plan (chosen vector stores, prompt scaffolding,
 *    observability hooks) that the generation stage can pass directly to the
 *    Responses client.
 *
 * The scaffold below returns placeholders describing the forthcoming plan.
 * Future work will wire up store-selection policies, prompt templating, and any
 * fallbacks (e.g., empty-store safeguards) required before calling OpenAI.
