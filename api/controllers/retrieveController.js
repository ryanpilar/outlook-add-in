/**
 * Retrieve Controller
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Because OpenAI's Responses API can invoke File Search on our behalf, the
 * runtime "retrieve" stage is chiefly about assembling the inputs that make
 * that tool call effective. This controller will:
 *
 * 1. Select which vector stores (and therefore which uploaded files) should be
 *    exposed to the Responses API by consulting the mappings created during
 *    ingestion. Pre-selecting stores bounds File Search to the right tenant/time
 *    window, improves precision, and keeps latency/cost predictable.
 *          Tools: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools
 *
 * 2. Derive search hints from the normalized email—subject keywords, sender
 *    domain, lightweight summaries—so they can be injected into prompts and/or
 *    used as metadata filters to steer retrieval toward the right files. Prefer
 *    deterministic filters when possible; keep hints concise.
 *          Retrieval guide: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/retrieval
 *          File Search: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search
 *
 * 3. Capture an execution plan (chosen stores, filters/hints, observability hooks)
 *    that the generation stage can pass directly to the Responses client.
